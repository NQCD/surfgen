jobtypes: 
1 = read reference, make surface, write surface to disk
2 = read reference, read surface, find extrema
3 = read reference, read surface, reshape surface
4 = read reference, read surface, output surface in new coordinate system
5 = read reference, load geometry information

Irreducible representation matrices are given in irrep.in
states are partitioned into groups that each n-state group carries an n-dimensional irrep.  
groupsym specifies the irreducible those groups carry.
The numbers correspond to the index in irrep.in.
groupprty specifies the parity of each group.
