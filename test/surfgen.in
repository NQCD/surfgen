Input Descriptions

[GENERAL]
Shared input parameters that are used by all job types

 printlvl    INTEGER
             Controls the level of output to standard output device.
             0 is lowest and 3 is highest level.

 jobtype     INTEGER
             0 Coupled potential evaluation through interface subroutines.
             other values should not be used


* The following input parameters defines the molecule, the electronic 
states and their CNPI symmetry.

 natoms      INTEGER
             Total number of atoms of the system
 atmgrp      INTEGER,dimension(natoms)
             Group index for each atoms.   Atoms with same group index will
             be treated as equivalent and the potential constructed will be
             symmetric with respect to their permutations.
 ngrp        INTEGER
             Number of electronic state groups.  Each group contains a set of
             electronic states that carry an irreducible representation.   
             For example, for OH radical the lowest 3 states are contained in
             2 groups, an E group with 2 states and A group with 1 state.
 groupsym    INTEGER,dimension(ngrp)
             Index of permutational irreducible representations carried by each 
             of the state groups.  For each irrep, representation matrices for 
             every permutation must be supplied in input file irrep.in
             Irreps are indexed as they appear in irrep.in
 groupprty   INTEGER,dimension(ngrp)
             Inversion symmetry (parity) of each of the state group.
 cntfl       CHARACTER*72
             If given, contains connectivity information that is used to select
             feasible permutations.  

* The following parameters defines the coupled diabatic Hamiltonian

 order       INTEGER
             Maximum order of polynomial expansion.
 inputfl     CHARACTER*72
             Pathname of potential coefficient input file. 
 eshift      DOUBLE PRECISION
             Shift all energies by this constant.  (hartree) 

* The following parameters are no longer used by most job types and are flagged to 
move to a different tab.
 usefij, deg_cap
             Used in fitting procedure only.


[POTLIB]

This tab defines the behavior of evaluation of Hd and the backwards
validation of data set during evaluation. 

* The following parameters control the determination of closest data point
and estimation of fitting error on the fly.

Each time Hd is evaluated, the subroutine will estimate the distance from 
the current geometry to all existing data points, the geometries of which 
are supplied in an input file.   The distance is taken in a selected set
of internal coordinates.  All permutations will be applied to find the one
with smallest distance.  

The fitting energy and gradient errors at each of the data points are stored 
in another input file and, along with the displacement vector to the cloest
data point, are used to give a first order estimation of fitting error at 
the evaluated geometry.  This analysis, assuming zero error in the hessian,
is not reliable when distance is large.  Its primary purpose is to locate
data points that are not well fitted but is being evaluated.

Time of evaluation, cartesian geometry, adiabatic energy, minimum distance 
to data point, estimated energy errors and current active surface data for 
each of the evaluated point is stored in output file trajdata*.csv 

 calcmind    LOGICAL
             This parameter determines if the minimum distance to existing
             data points will be evaluated.  

 dcoordls    INTEGER,dimension(*)
             List of coordinates that will be included in the distance 
             evaluation.  The numbers correspond to the coordinates defined
             in coord.in.   Intuition suggests that the use of a set of 
             exponentially scaled coordinates which forms a complete space
             should do the job if the scaling factor is properly set.
             Out-of-plane angle coordinates should not be included otherwise
             mirror images will not be properly related.

 gflname     CHARACTER*72
             Path name of the input file that contains all the geometries 
             of data points used to fit Hd.  This is the same input file 
             that is used in the fitting procedure.  The geometries are in
             COLUMBUS input format.
 errflname   CHARACTER*72
             Pathname of the input file that contains fitting energy and 
             gradient error at each of the data points.   This file is 
             automatically generated after fitting procedure.
 nrpts       INTEGER
             Number of reference points (data points that were fit)
 mindcutoff  DOUBLE PRECISION
             Distances smaller than this number will be considered equivalent.
             The evaluation subroutine engages triangular inequalities to update
             a list of upper and lower bounds of distances, and only evaluate 
             distance when neccesary. Setting this to higher value will result
             in lower number of distance evaluations but also lowers the accuracy
             of distances.
             

* The following parameters controls the evaluation procedure.

 cpdissmidpt DOUBLE PRECISION
             This parameter kills the evaluated derivative couplings upon the 
             dissociation of molecule.  A hyperbolic tangent function is used.
             The larger this coefficient is the faster the couplings decay.
             The program try to devide the molecule into two groups with the 
             largest minimum internuclear distance between groups, then scale
             couplings using this distance.
             This is only useful for molecules with 4 atoms.
             This functionality is turned off when this parameter is nonpositive
 switchdiab  LOGICAL
             If .true. , the two diabatic surfaces are switched in the output.
             This only works for 2-state systems.  FLAGGED TO BE CHANGED TO ALLOW
             MULTIPLE STATE REORDERING.

* The evaluation subroutine also generates a molden file which contains some of the
geometries that are evaluated.  

 atomlabels  CHARACTER*1,dimension(ngrp)
             Atom label for each atom groups, used to generate molden output
 molden_p    INTEGER
             A geometry is included in the molden output every molden_p evaluations
             When non-positive, molden file will not be generated.
 m_start     INTEGER
             Geometries of the first m_start-1 evaluations will not be included in
             the molden output.
