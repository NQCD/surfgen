   * Creates quasi-diabatic Hamiltonian by reproducing     
   ab initio energy gradients and derivative couplings     
   with selected data fitted exactly and the rest in a     
   least-squares sense                                     
                                                           
   * Blocks of Hd are expanded as polynomials of scaled    
   internuclear distance and out-of-plane angle coords     
   that are well-defined globally.                         
                                                           
   * Hd is constructed, using projection operators, so     
   that the diabats carry certain irreps of CNPI group
